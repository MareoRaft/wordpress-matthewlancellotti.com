<a href="http://learnnation.org/node.zip">node.pl</a> is a terminal based program which allows you to create graphs.  You enter nodes (vertices) and connections (edges), and then view your data as you please!

Both directed and non directed graphs are supported.  Features include, saving to file, merging files, undo, redo, custom color schemes, etc.
