The original Regex website was tragically lost in the GoDaddy purge of 2016.  An abbreviated version is below:

The Regex program allows you to use <strong>perl-style</strong> extended <strong>regular expressions</strong> anywhere on your computer.  Here are some examples of usage...


<!--more-->You can fix all occurrences of a certain misspelling, preserving the capitalization of the first letter (this example uses the regex "ignorecase" option, <code>i</code>, and the "global" option, <code>g</code>):

You can substitute with the "quoted" feature (note the <code>sq</code> instead of <code>s</code> at the beginning), so that no special characters need to be escaped (useful for simple find-and-replace operations that don't need special regex features):

Note: For the "quoted" feature, the regex delimiters may not be escaped either, so you MUST pick a unique character for them (e.g. <code>s@\qquad 2/3@\quad 2/3@</code> ), or in the case of brackets, have proper nesting.  The <code>e</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>s</code> regex options are not available, but the <code>i</code> option is still available!

You can save regular expressions under a keyword...

...and then whip them out later:

You can perform the classic "translate" operation with the "tr" keyword:

Note that a green checkmark will appear to indicate when the expression you've typed is valid.
