The original Regex website was sadly lost in the GoDaddy purge of 2016.  A much abbreviated version is below:

The Regex program allows you to use perl-style extended regular expressions anywhere on your computer.  Here are some examples of usage...

<!--more-->You can find capitalized occurrences of a particular word and make them lowercase:

You can substitute with the "quoted" option (using "sq" instead of "s") so that no special characters need to be escaped (useful for simple find-and-replace operations that don't need special regex features):

You can save regular expressions under a keyword...

...and then whip them out later:

You can perform the classic "translate" operation with the "tr" keyword:

Note that a green checkmark will appear to indicate when the expression you've typed is valid.
