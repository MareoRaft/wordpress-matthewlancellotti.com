This is just a safe place to store my wordpress website files for matthewlancellotti.com.  This is not necessarily up-to-date.


Note to self: To access the wordpress server, go to http://matthewlancellotti.com/admin.  The username is my most-common email address, and the password is written down somewhere.

Resume:
If you want to update resume, login to wordpress admin and upload a new media file following the same naming convention as the existing resumes, then find the Resume page and edit it, modifying the source code slightly with the new date.
